Restricting access to your vices may help in achieving your goals. Perhaps, though, just changing yourself is a shortcut here. Be more like Lore. 

Quit being that old self. Follow the Blessed Aim. 

Turn off the EC2 instances you're not using, you goof.

Know your own dreams. Don't swim in the dreams of others when you don't know your own. 

The future and the past don't matter, only the now. 

There's a time to strike and a time to hone one's blade. Neither are more important than the other. 

The mindfulness and the weight training have the potential to blend into one another, perhaps watching videos and other distractions during are hurting your progress more than you know. 

Strive to be doing something. Weed is great for when you're not doing anything but... why arent you doing anything?

When you're having difficulty with a problem (programming in this case) you can make dummy data or some other stop-gap, move on, and come back with fresh eyes later. Don't spend any more time bashing your head against the wall, just move on and keep getting things done. 

Make the app! Make the voice recorder converter app!!!
