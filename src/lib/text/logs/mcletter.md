Hi!

I'm looking for work close to home, I dislike driving in the winter. I'm taking a couple of Athabasca U's online courses and want to get a degree eventually, but I have a long way to go. 

My main food service experience with FMI started as a Sarnia Ontario Pizza Hut cook and I kept learning and getting promoted. First to front of house, then shift manager, eventually assistant manager and general manager. Before I left I was being put up in hotels and sent into troubled stores around South-West Ontario in Leamington and Windsor. 

I didn't have any special education or training, I was just following the rules and specifications and after 8 years working for FMI I left to move West. 

I've tried a couple things since, but the bulk of my experience remains in customer service and food. 

I'm applying to McDonalds because it suits my goals, my location and my existing experience. 

I'll probably be applying for a couple positions at the North Hill McDonalds, but my first pick is the overnight shift manager. 

Hope to hear back!

Tim
