A dog was delivered to me yesterday. It fits in my hand. 11 weeks old, a wee pup, chihuahua.

It's... a lot. Peeing, pooing, crying, biting, etc. 

But it's also adorable. 

Immediately the first thing I thougght of while caring for it is how much I appreciate and love my own dog, Sophie. She used to be a crying, peeing, pooing hassle. Now she's the perfect companion, even being patient with this tiny puppy we're taking care of together. 

I'm happy to be a trusted dog carer.
