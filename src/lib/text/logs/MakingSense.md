# 250 - Broken Conversations 

Discussing hyperwokism and how it's fuckin' fucked. 

I should set a boundary with bonnie and not tolerate this over-wokism. 

I have to set an example, and that is to say no more of this nonsense.

19:00 - Sam's summary of Rowling's situation (menstruators)

24:00 - Something has changed (culture wars comments) - Argument against wokeness.

> ... genuine white supremacy is a true fringe phenomena on the right. The people who show up with tiki torches are obviously retrograde assholes. And they dont, apart from the fact that Trump gave them some comfort with his ambiguities, we're not talking about real cultural power for the fringe on the right. 
>
> Whereas the fringe on the left really does seem to have captured academia and media and tech and hollywood. 
>
> Not every inch of it perhaps, obviously there's a ton of preference falsification; people who are just keeping mum or paying lip service to an ideology that they don't actually share. They're waiting for everyone to wake up so that it'll be safe to be honest again. 

26:00 - Star-chamber meeting. [Yale guy interview](https://youtu.be/xJbHkWTHiZ0?t=38) (i'd 2x speed 'er) - he specifically brings up Yale professor when asking the "executives" what's going to happen?

31:00 - Jesse claims that the woke police are essentially whiners, jealous and lazy and tired etc. 

32:00 - Sam and Jesse agree that, in the current time, black people have a massive advantage over whites applying to top 10% places to work or go to school. Sam would bet it all that blacks are massively advantaged. Sam thinks affirmative action was at one point absolutely necessary and good; now it's probably a net negative in all contexts.  

37:00 - Asians are being disproportionately affected by SAT scores no longer being considered and gifted programs being cut. 

39:00 - Net zero or net positive for whites, in the end. 

42:00 - Netflix guy fired for saying n-word [Jonathan Friedman](https://www.bing.com/search?q=jonathan+friedland+fired&FORM=AWRE)

47:00 - Racism comment. Sam doesn't know what he thinks and wants to talk to someone (Natalie Wynn?) about whether affirmative action should exist.

59:00 - Sam is in favor of reparations, feels like Trump period and wokism is regressive, criticizes Biden's [race based targeting](https://alphanewsmn.com/midwest-farmers-challenge-bidens-race-based-loan-forgiveness-program/).

63:00 - '[the reporting of Jill Lepore](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/the-invention-of-the-police)'

67:00 - [Sam harris doesn't think Isreal should exist.](https://samharris.org/podcasts/why-dont-i-criticize-israel/)

70:00 - Sam doesn't think Hamas should exist.

>Hamas is a democratically elected government whose charter is explicitly genocidal. When you do the psychological math on that, it's very easy to see the entire conflict from the Isreali point of view.  
>  
>There are people among us who can still remember what it was like to be the victim of an attempted genocide, and we now have a government who is telling us that that is their goal.  
>  
>And you want us to negotiate with them.  
>  
>And not be too concerned, when they, with their limited technology, they try to kill our civilians, our non-combatant civilians indiscriminately. There's just no moral equivalence between the two sides.

78:00 - Pure [millenarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism) ideology.

>These movements believe in radical changes to society after a major cataclysm or transformative event

82:00 - Sam suggests doing MDMA with the intention of discovering a part of your mind you didn't normally inhabit.

85:00 - Acid/psychedellics hesitancy is just "a healthy respect for the profundity on offer and you couldn't expect to feel any other way approaching such a momentous thing."

89:00 - Sam just spent like 8 minutes scaring a guy out of trying LSD.
