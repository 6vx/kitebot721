# Hoodie Comparison

Just want to figure out what I like. Make sure I only buy the right kind of hoodies for the rest of my days instead of playing russian roullete.

Bought around September of 2018 and wore extremely often, almost daily, for 3 years. Showed a lot of small wear by mid 2020 and started falling apart in earnest early 2021. 

Minor sleeve repair and small hole stitched Feb 2021
Removed drawstring to prevent further damage (every time it went in the wash the damage to the gromets in the hood became worse, one side pulling loose entirely as fabric thinned and fell apart) April 2021 

Loved the color, logo a bit glaring but it's Canadiana in a way. Normally I'm not one for wearing advertisement but I grew up on Roots. My aunt would get me a sweater probably once every other Christmas, and it was always the nicest sweater I owned. When I was in a weird place and had just picked up a good paying job it felt like giving myself a Christmas present. 

This sweater almost represents a part of my life. I'm wearing it in every photo. I adventured to the other side of the world with it. I'm very happy with how long it lasted.

Bought February 2021 when it was clear that my Roots sweater was experiencing rapid, multi-location deterioration from extended use. 

Immediately noticed that the wind came through it more in what was at first an unpleasant way. I had grown so accustomed to layering appropriately using a specific piece of clothing. Now I just see it as a lighter sweater that is sort of a placeholder until I find my next. It's handy, it's pink, it gets some compliments. I could imagine it becoming more of a work-out hoodie over time. Bright color is better for running at night than my usual black garb.

Excited for this to arrive. Hypothesize that the higher ratio of cotton is going to feel more like my old Roots sweater than the Basics.
