Listening to her use a machine to breathe may be the first time I've thought as one of my siblings as fragile.

The constant volume adjustment, selective deafness, mumbling, etc, all kinda fades away when I realize that she's one weird snore away from accumulating a disability. It's weird.

I think of myself as a durable, long-life-expectancy thingamabob, but now maybe a little less. She's a younger offshoot of me, essentially. Though one I may outlive.
