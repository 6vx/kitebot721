# 17 months later

This is the biggest gap I've ever gone back to retrieve something I've made before. 

Generally, I'd just write something new, or start over, but I knew that I'd done at least a bit of grunt work and figured it would be... recoverable. 

Digging through the 20+ javascript files figuring out which were essential was the first task. Luckily only half a dozen remained in the root of the project, the others squirreled away inside an aptly named 'scriptsalongtheway' folder. 

From the imports I figured out what data sets I'd need to reconstruct this, I'd apparently learned how to put my ./data folder on gitignore. Smart, kinda. Frustrating now. 

The dataset's creator is proudly trumpeting v4 when I arrive at the website. I groan, and download while checking the notes to see, indeed, that "v3 is now fully deprecated and (stuff I want) can be found in a new place!"

The 130+MB JSON file downloads. I run my 17 month old script. It fails. 

Once again i'm working with a dataset that crashes my editor when I look at it too long, and I'm just trying to get up and running with that to mash it into my other 200,000 entry dictionary and make them compare millions of times. My 2012 i7 weeps softly.

I refactor one script, it executes. On to another. I retrieve the acoompanying data. It executes... but somethings different. 

Perusing the code I discover I had no fucking idea how to work with Objects. I quickly rewrite key sections. It's **actually better** now. 

With fresh eyes and a little pain on my computer's part (I came back from my bikeride to realize I'd need to redo it with a small adjustment, sorry PC!) we managed to take this shoddy old crap and turn it into something... adequate. Almost.
