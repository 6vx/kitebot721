# Pretty descriptions

This seems annoying, and I definitely don't want to have to do it again, so;

## Main Stuff

- head should contain 
  - meta tags named description and keywords
  - title
- DNS records should be set for
  - google console
  - (auto import to bing console)
- Make sure you have an H1 on your site?
