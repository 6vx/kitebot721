# Two Fifths Rule

I need five skill trees for deathMetta, three already are provided. That means two of my own. 

At least a third of my ideas should be self implemented.

By using synonyms and unlocking additional synonyms I can offer the original diablo II naming scheme. I personally will have them as all the original names. Others can use whichever synonyms they've unlocked.
