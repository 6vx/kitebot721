# A Sidequest

WHAT IS GOING ON?! I hadn't noticed that ALL "I"s were bugged as I'd fiddled with my game. 

Somehow, when entering all my tiles values into firestore, I'd managed to mis-type one. 

A numeral 1 was showing up as a string '1' but not often enough to trip anything until days later. 

Of course, my brain ... couldn't handle this. 

Anyway, it was a fun little thing to track down. And easy to fix. 

Am pleased.
