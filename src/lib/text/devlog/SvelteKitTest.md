# Svelte Kit Test

### Adapter update

    npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static@next 
    
This was required to get on the correct deployment method. Initially was on incorrect adapter branch. 

### [Vite Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dansvel/vite-plugin-markdown)

    npm i @dansvel/vite-plugin-markdown --save-dev

This lets me read markdown files with the new Vite preprocessor.
