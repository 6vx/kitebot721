## How I use my phone

I need to edit anything on my site easily and make/adjust pages and widgets instantly.

OneSync maintains all my file syncing from phone to OneDrive. Once it's there I use RCLONE to handle the second move, usually to an AWS S3 bucket or a copy push build deploy workflow. 

Text is handled as Markdown files by lightweight app Writer Plus. It's fantastically light, offline, no ads, dark mode, constantly saving. It's great. 

Audio is now handled off-phone! YAY! But I can connect my Sony Icd-Ux570 to the phones USB c port and autosync to OneDrive as well. 

I still have the watch recorder syncing to the phone over Bluetooth and then onesync sends it to OneDrive.
