# Coding Interview

## Problems problems problems

A couple days ago I participated in a technical skills interview that got in my head more than a little. 

Essentially I'm too slow. It was three problems with a mix of data parsing, math and string manipulation, and you were to make three tests for each. 

I executed my complete, correct, commented solution for the first problem at ~40% time remaining. I knew I'd not be able to complete all three to my satisfaction before the timer ran out.

The instructions had specified that 'done is better than good,' though not in those words. I started to rush. 

Biggest mistake. I didn't find out till after, even had I completed the second in less time, I needed to have a chunk of the third done to pass. I may as well have gotten in the zone and tried to finish the second problem without rushing, since I was going to fail regardless.

Every time I looked at the clock I lost track of where I was in my logic, and found myself tracing my way down into loops and if statements all over again.

It was actually kind of embarassing how easily I'd become confused when all that changed from solving these sorts of things day to day was a time limit. 

I've known for a while now that I'm not an 'imposter.' I get the coding, I understand the logic, I've built up an impressive repetoire of experience across an array of technologies just from trial-and-erroring and following curiosity. 

That doesn't mean I'm a professional, though. Having deadlines, time limits and other mental pressures are going to be part of the daily grind, too.

So it's something that needs practising. 

I didn't get a gig out of this interview, but I still learned something.
