# retired webapps

Listing some rando jank I've deployed just so I can zip to it quickly. I wouldn't consider anything here finished or good, this is just for my own reference. 

## [Timelapse Calculator](https://metta.d3l112fu2xzrtu.amplifyapp.com/)
### Svelte, AWS Amplify

Input some camera settings and output the length of your timelapse. 

## [deathMetta beta](https://metta.d3l112fu2xzrtu.amplifyapp.com/)
### Svelte, Google Firebase/Firestore, AWS Amplify

This app was essentially a journal backed by Google's firebase. Any daily activity showed up on main page. Adding/changing content was handled in browser, and used Google authentication to restrict access. 

Randomized splash quote and title every load. 

Now mostly broken because firebase assets timed out. 

## [Kitebot beta](https://metta.d3nbkc9rp0l6tb.amplifyapp.com)
### Sapper, AWS Amplify

Super basic routing implemented in Sapper. Was mostly interested in making a Resume in CSS. All static. 

## [Svelte tests](https://master.d38djo7bohyam.amplifyapp.com)
### Sapper, AWS Amplify

Fiddling with sapper, static site. Just jammed a bunch of bits on there to see how they fit together. 

## [Math](https://master.d3vgm2uloi9xn7.amplifyapp.com)
### Sapper, Javascript, AWS Amplify

I felt like learning some javascript by solving some math problems with it might be sensible. Tried to pop in some CSS as well along the way. Problems hidden behind buttons. Console provides some feedback. 

## [Real Fake Words](https://master.d1ao765rkp1ud6.amplifyapp.com)
### Sapper, Javascript, AWS Amplify

Broken. Just fiddling with buttons, stores and timers. Did not go well.
