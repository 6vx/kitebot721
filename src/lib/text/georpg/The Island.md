Concert/musical on the beach. Greeted by an extremely serious Jack at the shore, but lightened the mood by dancing with her. Rick snidely wubalubas from the treeline between swigs of alcohol. Aang flutters by on his ball of air, racing to the event. Tycho is spitting bars in the crowd before going in to take the stage later. Mike is acting out tychos raps with funny prosthetically enhanced dances. Locke appears somber in his wheelchair... But breaks out into song and dance to BTSs 'Dynamite' exuberantly at my approach, prompting my crew collected so far and I to mirror his crews dance in an epic beach dance party musical. At the later part of song 
Zoku shows up to light the sky up with fire balls during the screamy fun ending. Vick shows up to chill everyone out with an instrumental violin piece and then a big pig floating through space steals the show with a sia song sung solar-ly, her giant hoofs bashing the moon and creating an awful mess.
