# mystic creek

## uncommon
## blue
## sprite noble

From suspicious individuals to families, boys chasing dogs and more line the banks of the mystic Creek as I ascend. Ive been pursuing the sprite noble for a long time now.

Faeries explode from the froth of falling water at me, but I am not the only one fighting them. A longbowman is nearby, downing targets from cover.

The sprite noble can't die, or not by any means I possess at least, and I leave him in a prison of his own bone. A warning to the others.
