##### by Stephen King

##### 4/5

## Why?

"The Institute" was good enough to get me back into a Stephen King sooner than I normally would. I hope it doesn't backfire. 

His books tend to backfire at the end, so you can't even bail until it's too late usually. 

## 0

I'm so down with this, it's got enough levels to play on that I can't imagine not being satisfied by at least one of them.

## 33

The pacing is interesting. It should be at climax but I'm only a third in. Are there really enough pieces set up to fall for the rest of the book? I don't think so. And I don't have a clue what the next arc will be, so... I'm delighted.

## 50

I'm delighted by the depth of the character, and the effort going into the separate narratives driving this thing. At this point I'm expecting a convergence of the autobio thread and the realtime thread, though I'm still ready to be surprised.

The girl he saves from the road is a knife in my gut, the scene too real and visceral. 

## 75

It's been a pleasurable journey. Not at all where I was expecting, and I feel like there's better places to go, but there's still time for it to get wild or get worse. We'll see. 

## 86 

Someone told me that the SK books are more about the ride and the feelings along the way than the end. They're right. 

When I started the layers seemed to offer an incredible amount of options, but in the end (or in the 86%) so far, I've discovered a narrative more in line with reality than I expected. I suppose there's still time to do a switcheroo, but there's no way this'll end up being the crazy book I was expecting from 0-24%. 

## 100

I don't want to set any expectations for others... but that's one of the best SK endings I've read. Because I tempered my own expecations? Because it really was that good? I dont know. The bar is certainly different.
