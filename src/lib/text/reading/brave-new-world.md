# Brave New World

##### by Alduous Huxley

## Why

recommended to me by a friend. 

## Start

Interesting scifi premise. I can see why it came my way. A tad dense for my taste. 

## Stopped Reading 

Didn't really like the writing style, found myself too distracted by it. On top of that, the core ideas have been disseminated through a variety of (from my point of view) better sci-fi content since publication.

I get it. But it ain't for me.
