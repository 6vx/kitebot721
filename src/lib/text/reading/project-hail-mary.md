# Hail Mary

##### by Andy Weir

##### 3/5

## Why?

I enjoyed the Martian, both the novel and the movie. 

## Start

Fun enough premise. Much like the Martian we've got a plucky scientist type doing science dutifully. 

## Mid

With all the pieces out I find myself pleased enough with the book as a whole. I could almost stop reading here because I can predict how the rest might go. 

Great setting, okay characters, but I'm not one for prolonged "imaginary-tech-porn." That's when an author goes into great detail explaining how their imaginary tech works. 

Stephenson does this too and can lose me sometimes, however, Neal brings the weird perverted shit to balance it out. It felt like Andy was having a couple stabs at it but it wasn't my cup of tea. 

## End

Satisfying enough ending. Would recommend to a sci-fi nerd but probably kind of boring for those that don't enjoy at least a little imaginary-gadgeteering.
