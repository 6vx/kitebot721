## play
 
I've been a co-op-aholic since as long as I can remember. There is nothing more entertaining to me than playing a game on a team, working together for a common goal, and winning things that don't matter. D&D, Tetris, Dodgeball, or that game we just made up. I just like to play.
 
Diablo, Scrabble, Morrowind and Starcraft 2 all had disproportionately large amounts of playtime, but I've tried a little bit of everything.
 
I enjoy running and jumping, too, so Ultimate Frisbee and Volleyball are my go-to sports. Throwing or catching things = yes. Waboba. Oh, and climbing things, of course.
 
## minimalism
 
I don't like having more than I need (might explain this black and white, text only website). I really don't like wanting for things I don't need.
 
This means I despise being advertised to. It also results in long, time-consuming mental gymnastics every time I need to replace a gadget. I am looking for something that is barebones, but capable. Affordable, but reliable.
 
I also end up eating the same thing most days, because having your diet all sorted results in a lot less waste. That might be extra trips to stores for ingredients, or extra packaging for erroneous items that end up spoiling, or... well, you get the idea.
 
## think
 
- John Locke - Passion. Choosing what to believe in. It's never been easy.
- Derek Sivers - The opposite is also true. Do not fall into the trap of thinking you know something.
- Sam Harris - Have difficult discussions. Truth is more important than anything.
- Vivec - Embody strength. Project loving-kindness. An iron hand in a velvet glove.
- Tim Ferriss - Prioritize based on what you don't want, instead of your desires.
- Derren Brown - Skepticism and more. Question what is influencing you.
