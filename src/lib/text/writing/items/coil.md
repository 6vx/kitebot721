# Coil

A priceless precision widget, engineered by artificers from across the ocean Dayang, at the top of Mount San. This quicksilver coil forms a bond with it's first controller. The pairing allows it's controller with the ability to see and move tiles in the environment. 

It's only got three settings, and one of them is 'off.' 

After that, it has the ability to imbue 100 tiles with energy per day. 

Alternatively, it can enter a boosted mode, and control Nanos.
