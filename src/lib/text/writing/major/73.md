## Outlaw

### Blankets to Bridges

#### "I swam."

Hands cuffed, her options were limited. Getting to shore was a struggle. Getting out of the cuffs was worse. 

They weren't too tight to begin with, a gesture of kindness from the officer extraditing her on the ten hour flight, so there was only *some* damage to her hands. 

#### Cozy

*I can't remember the last time I was able to relax like this.*

Kate was resting by a wood fire. She's been on the run for a couple years; since a different fire. 

***So*** *cozy.*

Her eyes slid closed, rapture overtaking her in a cocoon of blankets and a particularly comfortable seat.

#### Reading

Sturctural integrity. Hold everything in place or prepare for catastrophe. 

### Meetings

#### Triangulations

Perched on a bench, watching birds land and fly away in the distance, we shared a meal.
