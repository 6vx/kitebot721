Bev looked around the circle, five including herself. All hooded, all quiet. Anticipation crackled in the air around her. 

Lightning was shearing chunks of sky to the east, thunder rolling in several breaths later. The five would disperse before the storm arrived here on it's way to the lake.

Chad, to her right, passed her the torch. 

Bev moved the pipe to her mouth, sparked the torch and inhaled. 

"So we're in agreement," the figure to the right of Chad said. It sounded like a statement, but he paused as though he'd asked a question before carrying on. 

Bev was pulling her second hit casually, and waved a 'get on with it' gesture. "We'll meet back here," the figure pointed towards the plane suspended by a ten meter concrete pillar, "in forty-eight hours. If you're not here, you're assumed dead, and your share will be split."

Bev passed the torch, and then piped up. "No. I'll keep it." She looked around the four faces, anticipating dissent. 

None came.

*They **do** fear me.* 

Bev turned away from the scenic storm and began a stiff walk towards the park's entrance, the feeling of eyes in her back turning to knives in her imagination.
