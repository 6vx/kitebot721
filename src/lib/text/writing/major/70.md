# Kesha

### Seventh Bell Guardian

The humidity is suffocating, but we're almost through.

Transluscent sprites flutter upstream from me as I trudge through the muck and weeds. 

The flow increases as they warn the source of my proximity. 

The water around me gushes, frothing at the banks, spraying fine mist into whatever air remained below it's maximum capacity or moisture. 

Each breath is uncertain now, dripping plants growing so thickly that I must cup my hand over my mouth to draw in air without pulling something wet and green in with it. 

Kesha is waiting for me, when I pull the final curtain of growth to the side and the maze turns to a meadow.
