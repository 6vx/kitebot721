### Second Bell Guardian

Nash's eyes are closed. He intuits the position of the bells as they spin around him. The court is empty, and everywhere within ten meters of him is in immaculate condition. 

Littered beyond the aura of peace and tranquility the court is littered with the deep impacts of bells. The floor is shattered, dirty, damp in some places.
