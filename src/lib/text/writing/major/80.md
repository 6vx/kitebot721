# Vaush

## Eighth Bell Guardian

A fish fishing. A bizarre sight. 

And he's not even good. Like a caricature of a fisherman, Vaush is kitted out with bucket cap ringed with flair, giant eyeglasses each a fishbowl on it's own, overalls with one strap undone and a bizarre pair of rubber boots tightly fastened to keep water out.
