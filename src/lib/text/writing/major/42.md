### Fields of Pink Lightning

#### Bounding Merrily

So much power, so readily accessed. The field crackled with it, slender pink cracks of lightning as far as the mountain's foot. Munna's face is lit up with manic joy at the sight of it. 

I swallow the lump in my throat, and train him anyway.

### Perilous Pursuit

#### Little Time Remaining

Pushed so hard to follow in my guidance, Munna makes a perilous error. At the gorge, his balance fails, and he falls into the lava. 

I'm there in an instant, but both legs are becoming ash to the knee. 

I weave bone then, in what only I know is his final lesson. 

### Boneweave Boots

#### Fitting

When we fight the coming storm, we are at the gorge once more, boots fashioned of enchanted bone catching fire as Munna is buffetted by a slow wave of lava. 

The monstrous ridgeline golem is gathering it's mass, and I look into Munna's eyes. The pupils leave nothing of iris to be seen, and I know this spell will consume him if the mountain about to roll over him does not. 

### Underworld

Was it for me, or for him? Could I not just let him die? 

Did he begin to mouth something as the golem rolled past? 

Munna, I hope you're safe.
