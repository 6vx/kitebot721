# Oprah

Oprah's show ends on a high note, over the years only growing and growing. Tom Cruise's dance on her couch.... Muah. 

Oprah remembers looking out across her crowd of adoring fans. All of them as fired up as Tom on the perverted, cult-of-personality energy. Her smile was radiant, it even touched her eyes, but inside she was still afraid. 

*Will they see me? Will they see that I'm a GOM?*

Oprah goes to their happy place, then, before they hosted a talk show, before they gave away cars and trips and bizarre celebrity stunts, they were happy. Happy just being a GOM, in the woods, itching their back on a favourite tree.
