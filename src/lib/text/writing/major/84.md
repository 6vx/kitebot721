# Ephraim

## Femininity is a dagger

Ephraim's surveying the plaza. Is he stalking this woman, or she him? 

As his eyes trace over these women he sees a horrifying pattern. 

It elucidates slowly, competing with adrenaline as his body begins to understand he's in a trap. 

*Their shoes. All the same.*

Panic screams up Ephraim's spine as he stands to leave, or was it a knife?

### Journey back from Death

#### Trial of the Bell Guardian

A presence is waiting for him. It knows him, but he doesn't know it. The brightness of it's aura is at once startling and reassuring. This presence is so bright and mighty... that no knife will sneak up on Ephraim from the darkness.

One testing finger queries Ephraim's hip. 

*I'm still armed.*

Somehow Ephraim figured that firing upon this being wouldn't be fruitful, though, and he decided to take an easy stance. It wasn't five seconds before the being beckoned at him and began walkin. 

Ephraim followed.
