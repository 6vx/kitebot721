"... gave Günther leave." The soldier looked uneasy. Just the messenger, but of bad news, they recognized. 

"Under who's orders?" Gore was beginning to feel the walls closing in, despite the expansive plains around them, the open command tent, the sightlines to the horizon and ready legions standing amongst it all. 

"...Yours, commander."

"Find Günther and bring them to me. Immediately."

The soldier saluted and turned to leave with haste, eager to be removed from whatever situtation he'd stumbled into.
