### A Wedding

It's past midnight, late summer downtown Toronto. If not for the stillness of the air, it may have been too cold. Instead it was pleasant in almost any attire.

The dull yellows and oranges of streetlights are glowing, the air is thick.

Another sort of glow, one of special occasions hung around a group of people, sitting on the grass.

They laughed and chatted amongst each other, two women, a man and a dog.
