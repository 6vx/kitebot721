# Moash

## 배신자 반신

## Fourth Bell Guardian

A traitor, or a friend? How do I know at a distance? 

He frees his sword from the corpse kneeled before him and looks in my eyes. 

Potential. Hope. Love. Freedom. They steam from the body, dividing us with vapour as well as distance while our eyes remained locked together, unblinking. 

Mother earth screams in anguish as it reclaims the body, an eruption of flame and rock engulfing the gap between Moash and myself. 

And then he's gone.
