# Sasha

## 감자 도둑

### Sixth Bell Guardian

Standing on the wall, surveying the land outside, golden skinned Sasha takes a nibble of her pilfered rations. 

We have seen so much.

The sun begins to set on the horizon, glimmers of a rolling sea barely reach us, but are unmistakable. They remind me of the lands beyond the water. The enemy waiting there. 

Sasha holds out some bread for me, and out of habit I reach for it. Only my hand goes right through, and the spectre of my lost friend begins to fade. 

The strong woman I knew turns towards me as sha disappears, her face now pale as the day she suffered a bullet to her gut. Tears roll down her face, but she affords me a smile through her anguish... And then she's gone.
