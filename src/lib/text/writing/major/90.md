They think he's stupid, but I know that's not quite right. 

A tool, sure, but a fool? No. 

Behind those squinting eyes reside an intellect beyond that of the average person. Something more concerned with what might be than what is. 

He's old now, but at it's height, his power was unmatched. 

I let him keep breathing, as he once let me, and I carry on.
