# Molly Died

## She jumped

I didn't know what else to do. I had to call her. 

I'd had the puppy about a week now. I was supposed to have it for a week more. 

She just... jumped. 

With all her might, wriggling back and forth in my one armed grip, she twisted and torqued until she found the room. And she jumped. 

I knew right away when she landed something was wrong. I'm not tall, about six feet, so I'd guess she fell four. And puppies are supposed to be a little more durable. But not Molly. 

It happened around four o'clock, while I was crossing 11th Ave at 2nd St.
