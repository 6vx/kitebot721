## The Devil

### Circus

I'm here to die, ultimately. That's obvious. I've got an expiry date of around 2075. 

Pride, though, thinks it's immortal. 

Until one really, truly recognizes it; they're held prisoner. 

Luckily I broke free. 

From now on, I'm here to fail. I want to fail fast. I want to fail in front of people. I want to fail over and over and over as many times as I can before I die. 

It's the only sensible way to live.
