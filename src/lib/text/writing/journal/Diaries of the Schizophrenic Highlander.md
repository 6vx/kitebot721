# Diaries of the Schizophrenic Highlander

Strangling the stranger I found in my sister's apartment, I worried briefly what I'd do with the body. 

The writhing hadn't stopped, but apparently the threat had, because the plotting continued. I'll pull up to the side door.

How can I get in trouble for killing this... Imposter. How? When "my" body turns up with my DNA on it... But here I am... 

I don't want to think about it, it turns out. Maybe I should stay in the moment, after all. 

The body under me feels still, my hands release the neck.
