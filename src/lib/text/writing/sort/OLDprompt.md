Alex woke up in a place he couldn't remember, without a name, place or identity.

On the first iteration, if you could call it that, he awoke alone in an apartment he assumed to be his own. His head had felt like a herd of buffalo had thundered across his forehead, but beyond that, he felt fine. Even the throbbing pain in his skull began to subside like a tide, becoming less and less important as his consciousness returned.

Beyond this ebb, his body didn't seem damaged in any way. He flexed his fingers, breathing deeply through his nose. Slow in, slow out.

Beyond the amnesia, beyond the strange surroundings, beyond the fact he couldn't even remember his name, he felt fine. In fact, he felt fantastic.

He checked his own wallet, as it probably wasn't normal to wake up without knowing your name, and more importantly how or why you woke up where you did, and couldn't find a license. There was a university student identification that only had a first name, Alex, on it, so he supposed that must be his name.

Or he could be wrong.

He stood up, half naked, looking at the long and intricate stitching into his side. It was a strange tapestry, starting near his right shoulder and meandering down to his hip. It circled around, and with one hand felt it on his back. As if someone had taken a giant chunk of his body, casually flayed it open, and then sealed it up.

So naturally, he made his way to a local hospital. No name, no insurance, no real form of identification. But showing the giant and recent crochet job someone performed on his flesh was enough to get a few doctors to check him out and admit him. Worst case scenario, he's some kind of ghost. Best case, the staff can figure out some kind of way to identify him. Maybe help him. Whoever he is.

There were scans, tubes poked and prodded into various body parts, but beyond these initial disturbances, Alex couldn't particularly find anything wrong with himself. His arms felt fine, he could take deep breaths, and beyond a randomly pulsating throbbing sensation in his forehead, everything seemed fine.

It was the looks on the medical staff's faces that seemed to ring invisible warning bells. Their faces seemed not exactly concerned for him, but almost as if they were afraid. When they looked at the chart, they pursed their lips, looked away, and refused to explain what was wrong with Alex. But he knew. Somehow, he knew. When it came to bad news, staff would either downplay the news, or a doctor would hit you with a massive wall of jargon and specific terminology that the average layman couldn't understand.

So Alex sat there, shirtless, and began to poke and prod his side.

And for a single moment, felt something...off. Something hard.

Something metallic.

What the fuck was that?

The door to the observation room swung open, and a pair of burly men entered, one in a plain black suit, and another in standard nurse's garb.

He's not a nurse, a thought flashed across Alex's mind.

Not a nurse. Something's wrong.

In his minds eye, Alex is running through another hallway, white and sterile on either side, sprinting for freedom, away from the pounding of feet behind him, telling him to stop. Not telling, no, ordering, commanding, threatening him to stop and submit. His side a carnival of pain, his lungs almost bursting in his chest, but his feet pounded down. He had to get out. To escape, before they brought him back.

As soon as the vision appears, it vanishes. Was it a dream? Alex couldn't recall.

Where was that voice coming from? Why couldn't he remember?

1F "One last test," 

the nurse said, and before Alex could realize what was happening, he felt the flashing cold of bare metal on his own flesh.

He was handcuffed. Before he could even protest, his other wrist found itself shackled to the opposite side.

The man in the suit said nothing. Was nothing. Could not contribute anything. Alex knew he was the kind of man who looked at his orders, and nonchalantly carried them out. Regardless of time, place, or morality.

2M "What's going on?" 

There was fear now in Alex's chest, there was something growing in that uncertainty.

3M "You know what's going on," 

the man in the suit said. He held up what must be an x-ray of some kind, and to Alex's sudden and growing horror, saw some kind of geared mechanism intertwined with bone and musculature. There were no intestines, a single lung, and a liver, but it looked like someone had taken a shovel and scooped out half his guts to replace with gear and metal.

3M "There's something seriously wrong with you," 

the man in the suit says as if speaking to a child. 

3M "We need to help you, and help you now."

There's concern in the man's voice, but to Alex it feels feigned. Alien.

2M "Help me how?" 

he asks. What else can he ask?

3M "You're missing a ton of organs, kid, we need to get you in the operating room ten fucking minutes ago."

Alex's mind gave another sudden pang. There was something there, hidden beneath some kind of invisible blizzard of forced what? Information? Was something blocking his memory? That seemed so inconsequential, so unnecessary. What was abhorrent was the metal within him. While he wasn't on a first name basis with his own organs, he preferred them there.

I still have a liver, he thinks to himself insanely. At least I can drink.

Can he? He didn't see a stomach.

3M "Administer the sedative," 
the man in the suit says to the nurse, already preparing a syringe.

2M "No,"
Alex says. It's a croak, rather than speech. His throat has gone dry as sand paper.

He pulls with his left arm against the restraint, fighting, and an increasing sense of terror gripped him.

They want to take me away, he thinks. They want to take me back! There was some instinct, some hidden and intense hatred of needles. He'd stomached it for now, just assuming it was something normal to deal with, but now, in this man's hands, he couldn't stop himself, no there was no way he could stand still. There was something familiar in them. Something familiar and utterly horrifying in their presence.

How did they find me?

He would ask who they were, but that no longer mattered. There was a deeper part of him that already knew they were a people with no name or face, an invisible group. Omnipresent and omniscient, and Alex could hear a voice, distinctly not his own, hammer across his skull.

4A "Test four a partial success," 
it intoned. A dispassionate monotone. 
4A "Subject eight prepared for test five."

When Alex jerked his right arm, the handcuffs snapped with an innocent clink, and before Alex understood what he was doing, he'd freed his other arm and leapt onto the nurse, bringing him down in a single movement and cracking his skull with a right arm with a strength he cannot comprehend. It simply crunched like a giant egg.

Alex's body moved on its own, as if some kind of invisible training had kicked in, something he couldn't know or possibly remember.

The man in the suit reached for something, most likely a pistol, but Alex brought the right arm out again, a metallic and powerful hook cracking into the man's jaw.

The shock reverberates up his arm, so strong and fast as to cause his teeth to click together from effort.

The man's jaw is made of metal.

Like me, Alex thinks to himself. Metal men. Toy soldiers. Was he one of them?

The man in the suit staggers backwards, his eyes unfocused, shifting and shimmering as the pupils changed color.

Before he thinks, he swings again.

Once. Twice. Three times. A fourth, final crash, and instead of blood and brain and bone, a tangled mass of metal and gears along with a thick, black oil oozes in a terminal flood across the floor. The overpowering scent of burning rubber and frying electronics, so strong as to cause Alex's eyes to water.

There's jostling outside the room now, and the fear returns, a sledgehammer to the gut. His hands were sweating, coated with that viscous fluid. Sweat began to bead on his neck and forehead.

I need to get out. I need to get out of here. They found me, he thinks, though the thoughts are half formed and frantic.

Alex threw his shirt back on, looking at the pair of dead men on the floor with both confusion and pity.

That voice again, making his skin crawl, causing a shiver to run down his spine. If you could call it a spine.

4A "Subject eight has completed test five, and is ready to begin augmentation procedures. Schedule him for first thing in the morning."

He throws the door open, and finds the hallway deserted. No medical staff anywhere. No other patients. A ghost town, a place that had been crowded only thirty minutes before.

More men in suits in the halls, eyeing him coolly, as if expecting an escape attempt. As if waiting for an opportunity to use force. To hurt him. To take him.

Alex saw, with his heart hammering within his chest, that each man was as identical as the other. More metal men. More fake men. Coming for him, and Alex could see their grasping, implacable iron fingers grasping and pulling. That came with certainty, and he could feel now the strange clanking and clacking of the metal within his own body grinding itself together.

And he ran.

He ran for his life.
