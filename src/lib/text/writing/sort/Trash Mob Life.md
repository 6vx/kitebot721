Comic from the perspective of trash mobs.

A big new baddy is in the swamp. "I'm the boss and nobody can mess with me! The God's have blessed me with immunity to lightning and fire, and when I block you hear the sound of a thousand children crying!"
Next frame is just player characters digging through the pockets of the monsters broken body
"Did you find the armor?"
"No, let's run it again."
Next frame is a big new baddy in the swamp "I'm the boss and nobody can mess with me!"
Last frame is the trash mob main dude "just smile and nod and stay out of the way when the PC's come back"

Trash mob minding it's own business sees an adventurer coming in the distance.
"alright guys! New players with fresh characters coming down the road, let's show these guys what we're made of and have a good time!" chorus of "yeah!"s.
Next frame-"is that an aura... You can't get those till level 16..oh jfc, IT'S A CARRY, RUN FOR YOUR FUCKI--" gurgling noises as skin melts off skeleton as aura grows nearer.

Trash mob neurosis. A trash mob spawns with a crazy loot item. 0.0001%. Loses his mind with anxiety because PC has been hunting it for weeks.
First frame is him alone in a shed writing a letter by candlelight with some epic crazy ass mptherfucker of a sword glowing beside him.
Second frame is the letter.

Maybe better to imagine this as a trash mob hiding in a burnt out shack as mayhem occurs through the doorway in the background. His friends are being tortured and killed while he hides with his epic loot. 

"I know pc has been hunting this for weeks. I can't sleep. I can't eat. He's killed everyone I know hundreds of times looking for it. If I'd been born in any other zone my loot table wouldn't even let me spawn with this, and even now it's a one in a million drop. I can't get rid of it, but I can kill myself and make sure this mptherfucker never finds it."

Maybe trashmob is talking to someone or thinking to himself, mayhem through doorway, frame 1. 

Frame 2 mortally wounds seppukus himself

Frame 3 the unique weapon makes a hilariously bold SCHWING! noise and a glow beam forms around it. 

4 trashmob rolls his eyes as he dies at his misfortune.
