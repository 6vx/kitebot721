Tims Scrabble club

2$ month = upload 25 games per month onto the cross word generation algorithm service

6$ month = join the challenge club, every month get a special thank you custom made postcard mailed to you

Challenge club players can submit their games (THROUGH MY OWN APP) to collect prizes.

If players don't submit their challenge game, the players who do finish the months challenge split their ante.

Players who collect a double subscription (6$) winnings will join the double puzzle showdown in the next month.
Something like this anyway. Leagues. Etc. Fun irl element to it.
