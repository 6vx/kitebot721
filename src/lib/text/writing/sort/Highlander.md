The rush, so sudden. Unmistakable. 

I'm sitting alone in the kitchen, working on my computer. I shouldn't be here. There's construction outside the apartment. Right outside my window, in fact. It's very loud, constantly. And vibratey. And steamy. 

I'm planning my future and I experience a moment of rushing excitement, deeper than anything else, because I was peering so far into my future and the gleaming brightness of the multitudes of experiences yet to come dazzled me. 

Lean back, then, and ride. Take up as much as you dare, and then watch it pass through you like a storm. 

Welcome to your new life. Rest a moment as you settle in. I got you, bod.
