# Craterdome

I was marvelling at the glimmer off the observatory. 

"Find anything?" asked a voice behind me. 

I started. My reverie broken by the smooth, raspy inquiry.

A breeze rolled in over the meadow, and so turning away from the balcony I'd rested my glass on was less sorrowful.

Beyond the meadow, the edge of this manufactured garden dropped away into a fog as uproarious as Niagara Falls had once been in my youth. 

This "Château Everest" belongs to one of the founders of Nano-Terra, though my aide tells me she's on Mars right now. 

"No. I mean... Of course it's beautiful." 

At this time of year, at this altitude, looking upon the moon has an erie feel, like facing a giant you'd only ever seen from afar; only ever imagined this close. 

It's a very exclusive party, some of the original Nano-Terra projects, like this one, were slated for removal. The demonstration of wealth and excess was... A welcome sight when the end was near, but now seemed a symbol better left behind. 

Apparently Sarah, the owner of this place, had already carved Kilimanjaro and a few of her choice climbs into the surface of Mars, leaving lowly billionaires like me to marvel at these earthly wonders she leaves in her wake. 



"But you're looking for something more. That's why you're still here, when everyone else has gone home. That's why you're alone on this balcony, brooding." 

"I wasn't brooding, I promise. I'd just gotten distracted by a glimmer off The Observatory."

Another of Sarah's nano-tech-relics. It had been almost a decade now since this Château had been fabricated, and maybe five since the very last "homeless" human existed thanks to the technology. 

Apparently, the next thing you do after stopping climate change and providing shelter to humanity, is put a really, really big telescope on the moon. 

My interlocutor looked confused. "Observatory?" 

Now it was my turn, "... Yes? The one on the... ?" I pointed at the moon. Had this guy been living under a rock?
