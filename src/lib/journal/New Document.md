"That 불's hot, true or false?" (61) smiled coyly, setting up a logic trap for his intoxicated prey.

"I... True?" 

A question. (61)'s good, but I think his prey might be playing along, despite the hint of liquor I smelled with his response. I leave them to their games.

The beach opens up before me. 

I occupy a darkness, between the fire (61) and (03) are sitting around, and the smoldering fire raging on the ocean horizon as the sun sets.
