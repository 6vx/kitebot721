## Lauren: Jennifer didn’t think mermaids were real until she started turning into one, that is…

Mark: What… the frik are you talking about, Laur? Are you… in shock? You’re soaked!

Lauren: Jennifer, she… she’s… she’s a mermaid.

Mark: So her feet…

Lauren: They were like, webbing together. It was crazy.

Mark: Wow. So is she alive?

Lauren: Technically, I guess. She’s in the pool, out back.

Mark: What do you mean, “technically” alive?

Lauren: Well, Jared and I were alone with her and … I don’t know. It was fine. But then I went to the bathroom…

Mark: And?!?

Lauren: And when I got back, Jared’s clothes were beside the pool, and Jennifer was in the middle of drowning him in the pool.

Mark: Ho- I, uh – Why the frik did you call me and not the police? What the frik Laur?!

Lauren: Because I didn’t know what to friking do you friking asshole! I hit her in the head with my water bottle until she let go but it was too late.

Mark: What did you… so she’s… got a pulse? And… Jared’s… Jared’s gone.

Lauren: Yes. Yes. Please. Just. Please help me get them out of the pool, and… I don’t know. Then tell me what to do.

Mark: No. You go call the police right now. I’ll get back there and see if Jennifer is still breathing.

Lauren: Okay. Okay. Thank you so much for coming.

Mark: It’s okay. What the frik though… Just… just call an ambulance.

Lauren: I’ll be right behind you.

Mark: She’s… she’s breathing. Jennifer, can you hear me? Laur! Come here! She’s aw-AAAagh!!!

Lauren: Okay… okay Jennifer. You said you just needed the two.

Jennifer: I’m sorry Laur, I’m just… it just hurts so much. I’m so hungry.

Lauren: I… I can’t keep doing this. I love you but…

Jennifer: I promise, just bring me one more and I’ll be okay. Then I’ll be okay. Come here, let me sing to you for a while. I’m not so hungry I can’t sing with my best friend.
