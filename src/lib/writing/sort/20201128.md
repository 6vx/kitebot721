> Making Sense #226 – The Price of Distraction

> You are quite literally sculpting your neural circuitry in the meantime. Everyone experiences this in miniature psychologically but it’s another thing to remind ones self that there’s a physical basis for this a kind of living sculpture that its producing. This is something that we’ve been doing inadvertently more or less every moment of our lives and now we have the most well resourced and technologically competent companies that have ever existed turning their tractor beams on us and demanding our attention from every screen in sight and what you don’t take responsibility for here is going to happen to you based on other people’s business models. And it’s worth realizing that the causality here is not really in dispute. Basically all of these moments matter and they deliver to you your future self who will have whatever competencies or weaknesses or mounting dissatisfaction with life to deal with. And if your life doesn’t feel the way you want it to feel, there’s a lot you have done on purpose and by accident to bring yourself to this point and there’s a lot you may yet do to feel differently.
