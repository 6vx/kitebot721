How to make this game come true as soon as possible

I think that I need to prioritize smaller parts... I should look at the reddit post on this once more.

The tile effects are probably the most crucial aspect. Bonus tiles must look good and everything has to play tight and fast

Do you want to use ts particles? I bet you still do. And firebase to log in and track your character stats.

So then it's just a matter of css effects on the tiles, and a TS backend.

The game can probably just be handled as a TS file, and the initial gameplay grid doesn't need to be randomly generated by a server yet, any static thing is fine.
