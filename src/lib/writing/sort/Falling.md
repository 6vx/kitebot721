# Falling

## 1

My back is firmly against a tree trunk, ass to the grass.

I find myself at a beach... No. I think that I'm dead. If I look anywhere but straight ahead, I know I'm falling endlessly through fire.

When I keep my eyes straight ahead, though, I find myself at a beach on a small lake surrounded by a forest.

I've been here for a day and a half. I'm hungry, thirsty and exhausted, but I dare not fall asleep for fear of my head turning.
