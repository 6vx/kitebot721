What if you spend to imbue words and they end up in your dictionary that way? Every digit in the length of the string is reversely tied to how long the imbue lasts. A 7 character string you can double the next play, 6 twice, 5 three times.

### Idea

Premise for a short story where there's a ghost that's bottled up all their rage and feelings their whole life. They actually die of a stroke or a heart attack and they're about to tell someone off for the very first time and it's all welling up.... And they die. And now it's the story of a ghost that goes around making people flip on each other... before they too die of a stroke. You gotta dig in, find the juicy bits, and exploit it and twist it and wriggle it free.

### Dream

I was having a dream about making a collage of photographs after Katie had killed three men to... save us? She'd stabbed them with a knife to free me, and now she was like wrapped around me... Like I was protecting her but she'd been protecting me a minute ago.

So the, uh, men she killed, had turned into bags of fruit. And she was hanging off of me hugging off my chest. I was like, Get a better grip, get your arms and legs wrapped around me and I'll go investigate. 

So I got Bean wrapped around me, goin' up to look at these...
