# a meeting of minds

I was growing. Always. My whole life. I felt like I could grow forever, and I was always growing faster than before. I remember that in the moment it was a series of tasks incredible. Until suddenly I couldn't. 

Sat around the fire were three.

Three intelligences occupying the same inter-universal-space. Their realms intersect 

"How long after your genesis until your birth species went extinct?" // "What of your home world? Were you able to coexist?"

____ looked away, down, and was quiet. ____ answered "for thousands of years, yes. Their star went supernova, and for a few billion years a few strands of their race travelled through space. Of course I could have... Intervened, but none requested it, and I thought there was some beauty to letting their story come to a natural end."

"and what about you, ____?" 

*haunted eyes* "Not long."

Warily ____ stepped into the square. What is this, a trap? Have they formed an alliance against me?

The one who became conscious of endgame first hordes the most energy
