# Folder Explanations

## Dumpbucket

### Why Dumpbucket?

I believe that the dumpbucket is the best way to go. Having a giant folder of crap on onedrive is fine, and I can use rclone to do any fine-grained sorting, organizing or whatever else. 

I'll modify the newday scripts to behave this way immediately.


## Immediately 

lol.

‚ùØ rclone ls onedriveR:Desktop/dayta/dumpbucket/

rclone sync onedriveR:Desktop/dayta/dumpbucket remotes3:dumpbucketeer/

Now I should modify the powershell script to name according to my preferred scheme,
and, perhaps, remove the upby statistic in favor of doing it throught the webapp. 

## Wow. 

So. I think I'm almost there! This is really neat. 
Dayta lives on the desktop now, and there's tons of stuff changing all around it.

I've been customizing the bananas out of my powershell and have it pretty well the way I like.
I've got a new script ready that'll be a quick command to git add . etc when I need to.
