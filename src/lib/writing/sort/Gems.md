Gems

As you play a letter, if you hit it in certain groupings you get different quality gems.

Ie > 200 ms off of peak Green awards a 1* chipped emerald

100-200 ms off of peak Green gives flawed Emerald

50-100 emerald

25-50 flawless emerald

10-25 perfect Emerald

0-10 = leaderboard of some kind I don't know.

This is awesome because the skill directly ties to your score. But could still be completely separate for colour purposes.

If you KEEP this word in your setting, the next time you play it you will have a baseline value for your tries. If you scored a perfect emerald on a letter, you automatically are at least perfect this time. That way you can upgrade your saved words over time for big colour points. 

Imagined another way- say you play a word and score a 98% green and collect your flawless emerald. Now you have one more flawless emerald to pump into your highest level word. So you're going to be essentially levelling up your slots over time as you dig deeper into a color. 

I also could see the stage effect being integrated into the ui somehow, like the whole thing is a beautiful mosaic of rotating and moving pieces of wall. Oh man that'd be cool. 

By having score available from so many different metrics it really offers multiple ways to play. 

Rune stuff can be first handled by diablo 2 app.
