## How'd I Get Here

### Years of Toiling

I spent so long in tutorial hell. It was something I kept coming back to while trucking and railroading. I would put together small projects and eventually just delete them, knowing that such a simple thing couldn't possibly amount to the experience needed to start job hunting. 

I think the "job" aspect was the part that got me. I didn't know what I was doing things for, I didn't have the full vision for my life. So, while I had hints as to what I wanted, I just hadn't put it all together. 

### The Rest 

Then I found the github heatmap. Something about it encouraged me to just show up and at least fire up a code editor every day. 

Pretty soon I was building up collections of terrible scripts, worse than the stuff I'd been making in tutorial hell for years. It was, and still is, hot garbage. But it's *my* hot garbage, that I made because there were *things I wanted to do.* 

Suddenly docs stopped looking like confusing alien spaceships, things far beyond my monkey-brain, and started to look like gleaming treasure troves of knowledge, put together by monkeys like me, just waiting to be explored. 

This change came in bursts and dribbles, massive revelations and meandering connections. 

I audited Harvard's CS50 and found that the fundamentals allowed for a deeper understanding of stuff I'd been used to for a long time. Being shown concepts like big O notation were met with long sighs of "Of course, why haven't I thought of this before?" 

As I immersed myself in daily tid-bits and lessons, realizations began to come while I was out biking, feeding the dog, and just being around for friends and family. 

I used to watch videos about the latest web frameworks, trying to figure out how I'd take this strange knowledge and turn it into a job. I spent late nights piecing together auth I didn't need with the lorem-ipsum-filled front-end of a site I didn't care about enough to show anyone. 

Now I just want to make myself happy. It makes a whole lot more sense to me. That's my first job. 

Now I watch videos about Powershell from a decade ago to solve problems I actually care about right now, and if someone wants to hire my brain for money, and it fits with the rest of my life, that'd be swell. 

In the meantime, I just want to live in Western Canada and take advantage of this beautful land.
