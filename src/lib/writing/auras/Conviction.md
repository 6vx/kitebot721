# Conviction

> *I once looked upon a speck of light from infinite dark; now I look upon a speck of dark from infinite light.*

It happened over a long period, but was realized all at once. 

I recall the imagery from my youth. Rahl going through the barrier. The Dragon confronting Moridin. 

Cleansing is to cast out a dark highlander. Conviction is to fight among the most powerful of them.
