[{"path":"src\\lib\\text\\pages\\about.md","title":"about","markdown":"# about\r\n \r\n## play\r\n \r\nI've been a co-op-aholic since as long as I can remember. There is nothing more entertaining to me than playing a game on a team, working together for a common goal, and winning things that don't matter. D&D, Tetris, Dodgeball, or that game we just made up. I just like to play.\r\n \r\nDiablo, Scrabble, Morrowind and Starcraft 2 all had disproportionately large amounts of playtime, but I've tried a little bit of everything.\r\n \r\nI enjoy running and jumping, too, so Ultimate Frisbee and Volleyball are my go-to sports. Throwing or catching things = yes. Waboba. Oh, and climbing things, of course.\r\n \r\n## minimalism\r\n \r\nI don't like having more than I need (might explain this black and white, text only website). I really don't like wanting for things I don't need.\r\n \r\nThis means I despise being advertised to. It also results in long, time-consuming mental gymnastics every time I need to replace a gadget. I am looking for something that is barebones, but capable. Affordable, but reliable.\r\n \r\nI also end up eating the same thing most days, because having your diet all sorted results in a lot less waste. That might be extra trips to stores for ingredients, or extra packaging for erroneous items that end up spoiling, or... well, you get the idea.\r\n \r\n## think\r\n \r\n- John Locke - Passion. Choosing what to believe in. It's never been easy.\r\n- Derek Sivers - The opposite is also true. Do not fall into the trap of thinking you know something.\r\n- Sam Harris - Have difficult discussions. Truth is more important than anything.\r\n- Vivec - Embody strength. Project loving-kindness. An iron hand in a velvet glove.\r\n- Tim Ferriss - Prioritize based on what you don't want, instead of your desires.\r\n- Derren Brown - Skepticism and more. Question what is influencing you.","url":"about","html":""},{"path":"src\\lib\\text\\pages\\contact.md","title":"contact","markdown":"# contact\n\n### email (preferred)\ntim@kitebot.ca\n\n### voicemail \n[289-999-2320](tel:2899992320)\n\n### github\n[6vx](https://github.com/6vx)\n\n### linkedIn\n[godini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/godini/)","url":"contact","html":""},{"path":"src\\lib\\text\\pages\\forsale.md","title":"forsale","markdown":"# for sale\r\n\r\n## all prices $CAD\r\n\r\n### buyer picks up or pays shipping\r\n\r\n- [Surface Go](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/surface/devices/surface-go/tech-specs#:~:text=Tech%20specs%20%20%20Dimensions%20%20%209.65%22,authentication%20camera%20...%20%204%20more%20rows%20) - 500\r\n  - 64GB eMMC\r\n  - Intel 4415Y\r\n  - Grey type cover\r\n  - Stylus\r\n- HP Desktop i7, 16gb RAM, 500gb SSD, GTX 1650 - 500\r\n  - Bluray reader/burner\r\n  - Liquid cooled i7-3770 3.4ghz CPU\r\n  - GTX 1650 Video Card\r\n  - 16GB ram\r\n  - 500GB SSD\r\n  - Mouse/keyboard\r\n- Acer 4k HDR Monitor - 500\r\n  - It's beautiful\r\n- Nintendo Switch w/Base - 200\r\n- Voice Recorder - 100\r\n- Galaxy S7 (cracked back) - 125\r\n  - Still holds charge\r\n  - Excellent camera still works\r\n- Xiaomi Redmi 3s - 50 \r\n  - Dual sim\r\n  - Basic, working, good condition phone\r\n- Steelseries Arctis 7 Wireless Headset - 80\r\n- Umidigi Bison 128gb Dual Sim - 200\r\n- Yi 4k Action Cam - 100\r\n- 12' Cargo Camper/Trailer - 2500\r\n- Hahana Bike - 400\r\n- Jack - 200\r\n- 2012 Dodge Caravan - 2500\r\n  - Willing to trade for the right truck\r\n  - 312000km\r\n  - AC/Cruise/etc all work\r\n- Oculus GO 64gb - 100\r\n- 2 Sony car speakers - 50\r\n  - Brand new, unused, threw away box for space\r\n- Kindle 3G - 50\r\n  - Works fine, just not getting used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","url":"forsale","html":""},{"path":"src\\lib\\text\\pages\\nownownow.md","title":"nownownow","markdown":"# nownownow\n \n## what am I doing right now?\n \nWorking on PlayFab + Svelte demo repository.\n \n- 8/3/2021\n \n### short term (2021)\n \n- Coursework\n- work2021-2024\n    \n### medium term (t+2-3yr)\n \n- Degree ->\n- TKIP/TALK certifications\n- Learn some korean?\n \n### long term (t+3-6yr)\n \n- be bilingual?\n- living/working in Korea\n- more school ","url":"nownownow","html":""},{"path":"src\\lib\\text\\pages\\quotes.md","title":"quotes","markdown":"# quotes\r\n \r\n> How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness?\r\n>  \r\n> **Paladin**\r\n \r\n> Fate whispers to the warrior \r\n>\r\n> A storm is coming.\r\n>\r\n> And the warrior whispers back?\r\n>\r\n>  I am the storm.\r\n  >  \r\n> **E.Hunt**\r\n>  \r\n> *I remember walking to G-main one cold night realizing that I was an inevitable expression of the universe.*\r\n\r\n> There has never been peace without first a great suffering, the greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\r\n>   \r\n> **J.Lark**\r\n>  \r\n> *A villainous line, or something true?* \r\n> *Does not the acquisition of true empathy require personal suffering?*\r\n \r\n> If it be now, 'tis not to come:,\r\n>\r\n> if it be not to come, it will be now:,\r\n>\r\n> if it be not now, yet it will come:, \r\n>\r\n> the readiness is all.\r\n> \r\n> **Hamlet**\r\n \r\n> Build a man a fire, he'll be warm for the night.
