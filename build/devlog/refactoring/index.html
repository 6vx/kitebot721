<p>This is the biggest gap I&#39;ve ever gone back to retrieve something I&#39;ve made before. </p>
<p>Generally, I&#39;d just write something new, or start over, but I knew that I&#39;d done at least a bit of grunt work and figured it would be... recoverable. </p>
<p>Digging through the 20+ javascript files figuring out which were essential was the first task. Luckily only half a dozen remained in the root of the project, the others squirreled away inside an aptly named &#39;scriptsalongtheway&#39; folder. </p>
<p>From the imports I figured out what data sets I&#39;d need to reconstruct this, I&#39;d apparently learned how to put my ./data folder on gitignore. Smart, kinda. Frustrating now. </p>
<p>The dataset&#39;s creator is proudly trumpeting v4 when I arrive at the website. I groan, and download while checking the notes to see, indeed, that &quot;v3 is now fully deprecated and (stuff I want) can be found in a new place!&quot;</p>
<p>The 130+MB JSON file downloads. I run my 17 month old script. It fails. </p>
<p>Once again i&#39;m working with a dataset that crashes my editor when I look at it too long, and I&#39;m just trying to get up and running with that to mash it into my other 200,000 entry dictionary and make them compare millions of times. My 2012 i7 weeps softly.</p>
<p>I refactor one script, it executes. On to another. I retrieve the acoompanying data. It executes... but somethings different. </p>
<p>Perusing the code I discover I had no fucking idea how to work with Objects. I quickly rewrite key sections. It&#39;s <strong>actually better</strong> now. </p>
<p>With fresh eyes and a little pain on my computer&#39;s part (I came back from my bikeride to realize I&#39;d need to redo it with a small adjustment, sorry PC!) we managed to take this shoddy old crap and turn it into something... adequate. Almost. </p>
