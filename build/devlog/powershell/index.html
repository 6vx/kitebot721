<h2 id="draw-every-day">Draw every day</h2>
<p>I had the revelation that I&#39;d draw every day if I got the Surface GO. I didn&#39;t. </p>
<p>Then I decided surely I&#39;d draw every day if I opened my computer to a brand new canvas every day, ready to be doodled upon in even the most lazy attempt at art. </p>
<p>Enter: Powershell. I made a set of blank, root files for my &quot;canvas.leo&quot; and a daily &quot;journal .md&quot; and this script, after some wrangling, ended up being executed by the windows scheduler somewhat reliably. </p>
<p>Enter: RCLONE/EC2/BASH. &quot;Somewhat reliably&quot; wasn&#39;t good enough. If I turned my computer on later in the day, sometimes it would take a while to execute. Such troublesome behaviour was getting in the way of my zen art habit. </p>
<p>Instead, I&#39;d perform this &quot;daily script&quot; in the cloud on a CRONJOB on an EC2 MICRO instance, and then use RCLONE to sync between my ONEDRIVE account and the local files on the EC2. This was better. </p>
<h2 id="draw-sometimes-conveniently">Draw Sometimes, Conveniently</h2>
<h3 id="and-do-other-things-too">And do other things, too!</h3>
<p>Of course, in the end, I didn&#39;t want to draw every day. And relying on a cloud instance to fuel this unusual behaviour was sort of against my &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy when it comes to tech. </p>
<p>So now my customized Powershell 7 profile just has a script (synced to the cloud of course) that, when the mood strikes, allows me to type &quot;Draw&quot; into the terminal at any time to open a correctly dated &quot;timestamp.leo&quot; infinite canvas to doodle on. </p>
<p>Some other common patterns are immortalized as well, such as a script to update a github repo with a timestamped commit message, or to split a projects Terminal window in 3 with a remote TMUX session, a local server and a command line all in one. </p>
<h2 id="feelings">Feelings</h2>
<p>Powershell is fun. I would be happy to have more excuses to fiddle with it. </p>
