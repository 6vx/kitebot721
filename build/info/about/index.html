<h2 id="play">play</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been a co-op-aholic since as long as I can remember. There is nothing more entertaining to me than playing a game on a team, working together for a common goal, and winning things that don&#39;t matter. D&amp;D, Tetris, Dodgeball, or that game we just made up. I just like to play.</p>
<p>Diablo, Scrabble, Morrowind and Starcraft 2 all had disproportionately large amounts of playtime, but I&#39;ve tried a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>I enjoy running and jumping, too, so Ultimate Frisbee and Volleyball are my go-to sports. Throwing or catching things = yes. Waboba. Oh, and climbing things, of course.</p>
<h2 id="minimalism">minimalism</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t like having more than I need (might explain this black and white, text only website). I really don&#39;t like wanting for things I don&#39;t need.</p>
<p>This means I despise being advertised to. It also results in long, time-consuming mental gymnastics every time I need to replace a gadget. I am looking for something that is barebones, but capable. Affordable, but reliable.</p>
<p>I also end up eating the same thing most days, because having your diet all sorted results in a lot less waste. That might be extra trips to stores for ingredients, or extra packaging for erroneous items that end up spoiling, or... well, you get the idea.</p>
<h2 id="think">think</h2>
<ul>
<li>John Locke - Passion. Choosing what to believe in. It&#39;s never been easy.</li>
<li>Derek Sivers - The opposite is also true. Do not fall into the trap of thinking you know something.</li>
<li>Sam Harris - Have difficult discussions. Truth is more important than anything.</li>
<li>Vivec - Embody strength. Project loving-kindness. An iron hand in a velvet glove.</li>
<li>Tim Ferriss - Prioritize based on what you don&#39;t want, instead of your desires.</li>
<li>Derren Brown - Skepticism and more. Question what is influencing you.</li>
